* what constitutes client side validation?
	* use a library... 
		* like jquery
		* http://parsleyjs.org/
	* create your own...
		* when you click on submit, capture the event, and prevent default
		* then do validation
	* html5 form elements with validation
* what about jshint?
	* how can i be aware that you ran it?
	* i'll run jshint.... if there are any errors, minor deductions
* about authentication
	* passport can be really picky
	* if you're blocked by authentication
	* then fake auth (create your own user model)
	* (you don't have to hash, or store a salt... but note that in your readme)
	* on registration... create a new user
	* on login... just do a string comparison on username and password
	* add userid to session so you know someone's logged in
